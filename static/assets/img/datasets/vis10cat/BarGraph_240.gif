      <p><em>The NSW HSC Online web site has  closed permanently. &nbsp;The decision to close the website was made after  broad consultation with stakeholders including teachers and students.</em></p>
      <p><em>&nbsp;The overwhelming feedback  received from teachers and students was that there are many websites available  for HSC students to use and that information provided at HSC Online is of  limited used to those teachers who provided feedback.</em></p>
      <p><em>Students should talk to their  teachers about other online resources available and about the HSC syllabus and  whether information previously obtained from HSC Online is current for their  subjects. </em></p>
      <p><em>Information about the availability of  the content of the site will follow in the near future.</em></p>
